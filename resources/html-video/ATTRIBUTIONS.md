# Attributions

html-video is licensed under Apache-2.0. Some of its bundled video **templates** are
derived from open-source design skills under permissive licenses. This file records every
upstream we built on, its real copyright holder, and its license, as required by the
upstream licenses and by [RFC-07](research/2026-06-04-spec-07-ppt-to-template.md) (our
PPT-skill → template conversion standard).

> **What "derived" means here**: we transformed static presentation/slide designs into

Many of these design styles are themselves homages to real-world design studios. Where a
template is inspired by a specific studio, we record that as the **L1 origin** in the
template's `provenance` block — as a factual statement of inspiration, never as a claim of
affiliation or endorsement. Studio names are **not** used as template names.
